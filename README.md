# SentimentAnalysis
We aimed to do the most accurate sentiment analysis possible on a selected dataset, utilize that  analysis to train our model, and then use that model to extract both positive and negative  features from the dataset
Sentiment analysis is a data analysis process that examines the opinion information in text data 
and sorts it into positive, negative, and neutral categories. The purpose of sentiment analysis is 
to find and measure the valence score of the data and decide if it is positive, negative, or neutral.
Sentiment analysis is often used for many applications, like analyzing customer comments, 
keeping an eye on social media, doing market research, and figuring out how people feel about 
politics. Several methods, such as data pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification 
algorithms, are applied the perform this analysis and achieve as much accuracy as possible. 
These methods make it possible to analyze large amounts of text data. Then, various 
approaches are followed to apply the analysis in some use cases depending upon the dataset 
used. Sentiment analysis for product reviews can help businesses figure out what their 
customers think and like so they can make their goods and services better. There are various 
studies already completed and, in the process to achieve high accuracy in predicting sentiment, 
so it is an ongoing and popular field of study that can be proven high-yielding and profitable 
for companies and manufacturers in the future. We performed the analysis to find out more 
and achieve more accuracy by training models and evaluating them. We used a dataset 
available in the public domain containing reviews from people about some womenâ€™s clothing. 
We also used the trained model to find out the words associated with the text and sentiment. 
Then, we implemented a web application to take user input and provide valence score and 
sentiment category. We also discussed the limitations of sentiment analysis such as being 
unable to differentiate between sarcasm, irony, and linguistic indifferences. This abstract 
outlines the most important ideas and methods used in sentiment analysis, how it is used, and 
the problems it faces
